# 90 Days DevOps Learning Plan – 2026

## My Current Level
I have prior hands-on experience in IT and DevOps-related roles, working with Linux, Git, Docker, AWS, Terraform, and CI/CD pipelines.
After a career break, I am now returning to DevOps engineering with a focused and disciplined approach.
Over the next 90 days, my goal is to strengthen fundamentals, connect concepts end to end, and rebuild strong hands-on confidence to be fully prepared for DevOps and Cloud engineering roles.


## My Understanding of DevOps & Cloud
Any software or code needs infrastructure to run on — whether it is a laptop, a server, or a large-scale platform.
For example, an application like Flipkart requires physical resources such as CPU, memory, storage, databases, and networking to function and serve users reliably.

Once the code is written, it is not enough to just “deploy” it.
To make the application available to millions of users over the internet, we need proper networking, DNS, load balancing, security, monitoring, and continuous troubleshooting.

This entire responsibility — from packaging the application, deploying it, scaling it, monitoring it, and fixing issues when something breaks — is where DevOps comes in.
DevOps is not just about tools. It is a mindset of organizing different processes and creating a smooth, continuous flow between development and operations.

For infrastructure, all these components like CPU, memory, storage, databases, and networking need to be combined correctly to create an environment where applications can run.
Managing physical infrastructure manually is expensive, complex, and difficult to scale. Cloud computing solves this problem by providing infrastructure and services over the internet.
Instead of owning and managing physical hardware, we can create, modify, and scale infrastructure on demand, while the actual physical resources are managed by cloud providers.

In simple terms, cloud allows us to access infrastructure as needed over the internet, while DevOps focuses on how we use that infrastructure efficiently to build, deploy, and operate software reliably.


## Why I Am Learning DevOps & Cloud
I am learning DevOps and Cloud to get back into the industry with stronger, more practical skills. 
While I have worked with DevOps tools before, I want to clearly understand how everything fits together and be able to apply it confidently in real situations.
My aim is to gain hands-on experience with complete workflows such as deployment, automation, monitoring, and troubleshooting, instead of just knowing individual tools.
I want to reach a level where I can take responsibility for systems and handle real production issues.
At the same time, I am working toward securing a stable and well-paying DevOps or Cloud role where I can grow professionally and contribute meaningfully.

This 90-day journey is my way of building discipline, consistency, and real confidence through daily practice.

## Where I Want to Reach in 90 Days
By the end of these 90 days, I want to be confident in working with core DevOps tools and workflows in a practical, end-to-end manner.
My main goals are:
1. Design and deploy an application using Docker, CI/CD pipelines, and Kubernetes with a clear understanding of how each component works together.
2. Implement monitoring, logging, and alerting to understand system behavior and identify issues proactively.
3. Develop enough hands-on confidence to debug failures, explain design choices, and confidently interview for DevOps and Cloud engineering roles.

## Core DevOps Skills I Will Build
1. Kubernetes.
2. Terraform.
3. CI/CD pipelines.
4. Linux and Python.
5. AI-automation.

## How I will stay consistent every single day 
I will study for minimum 3 hours on weekdays and 4 to 6 hours on weekends and post my learning on linkdin and commit my work on github.
